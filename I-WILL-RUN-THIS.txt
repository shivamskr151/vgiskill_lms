🚀 EXECUTE THIS TO DEPLOY AND RUN POD
==========================================

I've prepared everything. Due to shell access limitations in this 
environment, please run this single command to deploy everything:

cd /Users/shivam/Downloads/variphi-lms-app/vgiskill_lms && chmod +x execute-now.sh && ./execute-now.sh

OR run the simpler version:

cd /Users/shivam/Downloads/variphi-lms-app/vgiskill_lms
./execute-now.sh

This will:
1. Build Docker image (15-20 min)
2. Push to registry
3. Deploy to GKE
4. Show pod status

After running, you'll see your pod status!

==========================================
QUICK CHECK (after deployment)
==========================================

kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=frappe-lms

This will show if your pod is running!
